name: Dump LSASS.exe Memory using Out-Minidump.ps1
description: |
    The memory of lsass.exe is often dumped for offline credential theft attacks. This test leverages a pure
    powershell implementation that leverages the MiniDumpWriteDump Win32 API call.
    Upon successful execution, you should see the following file created $env:TEMP\lsass_*.dmp.
