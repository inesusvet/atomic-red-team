name: Dump Active Directory Database with NTDSUtil
description: |
    This test is intended to be run on a domain Controller.

    The Active Directory database NTDS.dit may be dumped using NTDSUtil for offline credential theft attacks. This capability
    uses the "IFM" or "Install From Media" backup functionality that allows Active Directory restoration or installation of
    subsequent domain controllers without the need of network-based replication.

    Upon successful completion, you will find a copy of the ntds.dit file in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.
