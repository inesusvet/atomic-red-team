name: Snake Malware Registry Blob
description: |
    The following Atomic Test creates a registry blob in HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\.wav\OpenWithProgIds, which is related to Snake Malware. Per the report, upon execution, Snake's WerFault.exe will attempt to decrypt an encrypted blob within the Windows
    registry that is typically found at HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\.wav\OpenWithProgIds. The encrypted data includes the AES key, IV, and path that is used to find and decrypt the file containing Snake's kernel driver and kernel driver loader.
