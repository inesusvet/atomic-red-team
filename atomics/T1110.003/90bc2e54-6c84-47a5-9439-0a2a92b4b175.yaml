api_version: "2.0"
name: Password Spray all Domain Users
description: |-
    CAUTION! Be very careful to not exceed the password lockout threshold for users in the domain by running this test too frequently.
    This atomic attempts to map the IPC$ share on one of the Domain Controllers using a password of Spring2020 for each user in the %temp%\users.txt list. Any successful authentications will be printed to the screen with a message like "[*] username:password", whereas a failed auth will simply print a period. Use the input arguments to specify your own password to use for the password spray.
    Use the get_prereq_command's to create a list of all domain users in the temp directory called users.txt.
