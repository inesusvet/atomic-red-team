description: |
    This program executes shellcode in the current process using the following steps
    1. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAlloc setting the page permissions to Read/Write
    2. Use the RtlCopyMemory macro to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space
    3. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtect
    4. Call CreateThread on shellcode address
    5. Call WaitForSingleObject so the program does not end before the shellcode is executed

    This program loads the DLLs and gets a handle to the used procedures itself instead of using the windows package directly.
