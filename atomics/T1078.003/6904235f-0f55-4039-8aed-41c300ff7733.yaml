name: Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account
description: "PsExec is a powerful tool most known for its remote management capability. However, it can also be used to run processes as the local system account.\n\nThe local system account is a default windows account which has unrestricted access to all system resources.\n\nUpon successful execution, PsExec.exe will spawn a command prompt which will run 'whoami' as the local system account and then exit.    \n"
