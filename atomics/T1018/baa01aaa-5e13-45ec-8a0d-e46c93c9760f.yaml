name: Remote System Discovery - nslookup
description: |
    Powershell script that runs nslookup on cmd.exe against the local /24 network of the first network adaptor listed in ipconfig.

    Upon successful execution, powershell will identify the ip range (via ipconfig) and perform a for loop and execute nslookup against that IP range. Output will be via stdout.
