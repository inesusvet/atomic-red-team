name: Discover System Language by Environment Variable Query
description: |
    Identify System language by checking the environment variables

    Upon successful execution, the 5 character locale result can be looked up to
    correlate the language and territory. Environment query commands are likely
    to run with a pattern match command e.g. `env | grep LANG`

    Note: `env` and `printenv` will usually provide the same results. `set` is
    also used as a builtin command that does not generate syscall telemetry but
    does provide a list of the environment variables.
