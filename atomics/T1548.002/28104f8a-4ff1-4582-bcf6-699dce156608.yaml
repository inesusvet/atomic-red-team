    Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task on Windows 8-10 using bat file from https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/ajtrws/bypassing_highest_uac_level_windows_810/

    There is an auto-elevated task called SilentCleanup located in %windir%\system32\cleanmgr.exe This can be abused to elevate any file with Administrator privileges without prompting UAC (even highest level).

    For example, we can set the windir registry kye to: "cmd /k REM "

    And forcefully run SilentCleanup task:

    schtasks /run /tn \Microsoft\Windows\DiskCleanup\SilentCleanup /I

    REM will tell it to ignore everything after %windir% and treat it just as a NOTE. Therefore just executing cmd with admin privs.
